Reviewer comments:

Instead of the current approach you can use python's built-ins/standard libraries to simplify things for you. The defaultdict from the collections library can be used for building a dictionary where if a key already exists the value is modified in some way, but if the key doesnâ€™t exist some type of default value is entered

from collections import defaultdict

call_dict = defaultdict(int)
for call in calls:
    call_dict[call[0]] += int(call[3])
    call_dict[call[1]] += int(call[3])

Defaultdict will automatically fill in missing keys with when required.
