# How to solve problems

## Steps
- Don't Panic!
- Understand the problem
    - What are the inputs?
    - What are the outputs?
    - What is the relationship between the inputs and outputs
    - What are the assumptions and constraints
- Work through some examples by hand
- Create test cases from these examples
- Come up with simple and mechanical solution (Google for for others have solved the problem)
- Write down pseudo-code to clarify control flow and helper functions required
- Implement helper functions
- Implement tests for helper functions
- Test overall solution using test cases (created from hand computed examples before)
- Review implementation for performance and efficiency. But don't optimise prematurely. Bias towards 'simple and correct'.
